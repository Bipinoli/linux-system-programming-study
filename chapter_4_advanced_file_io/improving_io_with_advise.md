## Improving IO performance with advise to kernel

To improve the IO performance kernel often employs readahead tactics. As per the hit or miss, the readahead is tweaked on the fly. For example, the file maybe being read-on sequentially. The kernel starts by reading slightly more pages from the disk than needed. So that in future reads, it can save some disk fetch. As per the success of this, it will do larger and larger readahead. Until that stops helping. This is a good tactics as the disk IO is substantially slower compared to the cpu. With disk IO latency is a big problem however it can manage a big thoughput quite easily i.e big chunk of data but moving slowly.

Kernel provides the system calls, madvise() for memory from mmap(), posix_fadvise() / readahead() for normal file descriptors, to allow processes to make the File IO intention more clear to the kernel such that it can tweak it's tactics early and accordingly for performance gains. With advise, processes can tell kernel that they are going to do whether random IO, or sequential IO, or maybe they don't even need anything, or maybe they are going to reuse something, etc. These advises are rather cheap and the timely advise can improve the IO perforamnce. Therefore, it is good to keep advising in mind. However, advise is like the name suggests, just an advise. It is upto the kernel to do something with that. Different kernels might decide to do do differnt things as per the advise.
